    On the edge of the world, where waves slammed endlessly against jagged cliffs, stood an old lighthouse. Its white paint had long peeled away, and rust streaked its iron frame. But every night, without fail, the light turned.

Inside lived Elias, the last lightkeeper.

No one visited anymore. GPS and satellite systems had made the old light obsolete, but Elias remained. Not out of duty, or loneliness, but because of a promise.

Forty years earlier, his wife Mara had vanished at sea during a storm. Search parties found nothing—no wreckage, no trace—just endless grey water. Everyone said she was gone. Elias didn’t believe them.

She was a sailor, clever and stubborn. If anyone could survive, it was her. And she had said, not long before the storm, “If anything ever happens, wait for me by the light. I’ll find my way back.”

So he did.

Year after year, through broken storms and clear nights, he kept the light burning. Townsfolk called him mad. Some offered to take over, to give him peace. He refused. The light must never go out.

One autumn evening, as the sun sank red into the sea, Elias sat by the lens, listening to the gulls cry.

Then he saw it.

Far in the distance, a small sail — old, patched, swaying on the horizon. He blinked hard. The binoculars trembled in his hands.

A boat. Drifting. Coming home.

And standing at the helm, waving like a signal flag in the dusk — a woman with sea-glass eyes and wind-wild hair.

The sea had given her back.

The light had done its job.
